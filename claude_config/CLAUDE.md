Read the instructions under `~/.claude/rules`

NEVER make PRs/diffs on your own. Also, never ammend to / rebase existing commits to commit your changes, unless I explicitly ask you to. IF you wish to commit your changes (which you usually shouldn't), ALWAYS create a new commit for each individual change you make. Focus on making things easily reviewable for me, and always expect me to thoroughly review your changes before they are pushed remotely;

If the file you are editing contains commented out code, do NOT modify the comments unless you're specifically asked to do so.
