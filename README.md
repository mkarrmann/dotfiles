Not really just dotfiles per se. Any setup scripts and files I want to share across all my machines.

# Mac and Linux

Dotfile git repo.

First run init.sh to symlink dotfiles.

Then download vim relative line numbers from https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2351

Follow instructions to install, run:

vim RltvNmbr.vba.gz
:so %

# Mac

On mac, run `cp -r CatchMouse.app/ ~/Applications/` to install CatchMouse.

Also install Karabiner-Elements from online and hammerspoon from brew.

# Windows

Press `Windows key` + `r` to open `Run`
Enter `shell:startup`
Copy `.exe` files to this directory
